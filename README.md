# TroopTrackerViewAttachment

## Overview
**TroopTrackerViewAttachment** is a XenForo addon developed for the Florida Garrison Troop Tracker. Its primary purpose is to enable image attachments to be visible to guests from direct_url. This addon was specifically created to address an issue with the Florida Garrison's custom mobile app, which could not display attachments via the XenForo API.

While this addon was designed to solve a specific problem for the Florida Garrison, it has broader applicability and can be used in similar scenarios where guest access to attachments is required.
